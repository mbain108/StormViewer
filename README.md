# StormViewer
Hacking with Swift (Paul Hudson)

In this project I produced an application that lets users scroll through a list of images, then select one to view.

Some of the things covered:
~ constants and variables
~ method overrides
~ table views and image views
~ app bundles
~ FileManager
~ typecasting
~ arrays
~ loops
~ optionals
~ view controllers
~ storyboards
~ outlets
~ Auto Layout
~ UIImage
~ and more
